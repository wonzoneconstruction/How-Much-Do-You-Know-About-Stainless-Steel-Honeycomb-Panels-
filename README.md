Stainless steel honeycomb panels

 The table plate is made of brushed stainless steel or mirror stainless steel, the back plate is made of galvanized steel, and the core material is made of aluminum honeycomb core, which is compounded by special adhesive. Its beautiful appearance makes it widely popular with architectural application and interior decoration.

 Main features of stainless steel honeycomb panel

 1.Light weight, low installation load. 2. Large area, high flatness, not easy to deform, high safety factor. 3. Good sound insulation, insulation performance. 4. Low cost, good quality, price is lower than 2mm stainless steel veneer, but flatness is higher than 3mm stainless steel veneer.

 Stainless steel honeycomb panel parameters

 1.The panel is made of sus304 stainless steel from Jiugang or Taigang, or 201 stainless steel from Hongwang and Lianzhong. The surface of stainless steel is plated by copper electroplating technology or PVD vacuum ion plating technology. The panel can be brushed, mirrored, sanded, textured, etched. The thickness can be: 0.5-3.0mm.

 2.The bottom plate can be stainless steel plate, aluminum plate, and galvanized plate. The thickness can be: 0.5-2.0mm.

 3.Aluminum honeycomb core material adopts hexagonal 3003H18 aluminum foil. The aluminum foil thickness is 0.38-0.68mm, and side length is 4-6mm.

 4.Stainless steel honeycomb panel specifications: length is less than 5000mm/ width is less than 1500mm, thickness is 5-100mm. Special specifications can be customized.

 The stainless steel project will be in service for many years. This durability means it plays a major role in developing more sustainable societies: improving energy efficiency, reducing pollution, and reducing the use of materials. Moreover, the value of all alloying elements (not just nickel) provides a strong incentive. At the end of the life of the stainless steel product, these substances are recycled and reused for the production of stainless steel. In fact, stainless steel is one of the most recycled materials of all. The only factor limiting the reuse of stainless steel is that so many stainless steel projects are still in use after many years. Some of the features of stainless steel honeycomb make it the fastest growing material used today. It is an important solution to the sustainability challenges that the world is faced with.
